A grotesque and nearly hairless biped, the meazel lurks in underdark environments, and attacks its victims from behind, garroting smaller prey or in the case of larger prey, by lunging at them in the dark and teleporting them into a nearby lair, where other foul creatures finish off the unsuspecting victim.

#### Introduction
Borislav is a human fighter born from the riverlands of [[Zeilona]], a territory annexed into the Empire of Gloridia. A weary sort, the adult male rocks a short bowlcut hairstyle, a walrus-style mustache, and a small scar affixed to his nose from his first battle. Borislav keeps in touch with his kinsmen with the occasional letters and gifts from his travels. Above all else, he is a family man.

#### Background
Raised in a small agricultural village. As oldest of 8 sibling, he was always expected to watch out for his family and be helpful on the farm plot. It was a simple life, but by the age of 6 he wondered of the world beyond the village borders. The mystical beasts and Exotic lands of the story book called him in his dreams. It wasn't until the village faced hard times (multiple years of crop failure) that he thought of his "brilliant" plan. he would become a soldier!

A life of adventure surely waited there! His parents were strictly against the idea. thinking he'd get himself hurt, or worse, killed. the dream was temporarily crushed, but as food became harder and harder to come by, his folks begrudgingly accepted. He enlisted right away, did his basic training, and was away on his adventurous new life!....or so he thought. It was nothing but 5 years of Standing guard, monthly patrols of the countryside, and training drills. There was the occasional brawl, sure, but left a lot to be desired. the pay wasn't great either. He barely was able to send any money home. it was enough to live on, but he wanted his home to thrive. After his service was up, he had saved enough to buy his issued equipment from The Quartermaster and set out on the true journey he's waited his whole life for!

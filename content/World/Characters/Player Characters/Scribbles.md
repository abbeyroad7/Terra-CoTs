# Introduction
Scribbles is an adult Kenku and wizard. He happened upon the rest of the Ball Fondlers on their encroach to the city of Aurelia and attempted to warn them before they encountered a patrol of Celestrian soldiers. Once the party was discovered however, he stood by their side and thrwarted off the aggressors. Afterwards, he joined the Ball Fondlers into the sewers with the guidance of [[Peroc, the Scavenger]] and his orange tabby, [[Tarog, the Tabby Cat|Tarog]].

# Background
Born in the United Tribes of Moomia, Scribbles has spent a majority of his life, and nearly all of his adult life, studying as a wizard's apprentice in the Moomian capital of Shah, delving into the school of evocations spells. In the capital of Shah, magical teachings have largely remained unaffected by the fog of skepticism and stigma enshrouding Gloridia and the western kingdoms. The time Scribbles spent studying, as well as his races' innate inability to speak the Common tongue, stunted his social skills making it difficult for him to relate to others.

He spent most of his time with his beak in the books rather than out on the town. Looking for a chance to spread his metaphorical wings as a full-fledged wizard, Scribbles decided to travel to the Gloridian capital of Aurelia to discover the lost tomes of knowledge buried, burned, or abandoned by the western by the Western powers after the bloody Arcanum Wars.

# Evolution
In short time after joining the Ball Fondlers, Scribbles and his comrades came upon a druidic spellbook in the abandoned Tanner's Market just outside the city walls of Aurelia. Here, they gathered the necessary ingredients, including Borislav's spit, and concocted what [[Freya]] translated as the [[Phylactery of Yappery]]. With this potion, Scribbles was granted the ability to speak the Common tongue.

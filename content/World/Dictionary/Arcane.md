# Introduction
The source of magical energy in the world of [[Terra]]. Commonly referred to as Creation Energy by [[Arilias, the One True Creator|Arilias']] followers.

# Origins
In the before, it is believed [[Arilias, the One True Creator|Arilias]] channeled a surge of [[Arcane|Arcana]] to create the world of [[Terra]]. By doing so, He yielded an influx of dark energy that was disproportionately greater than its precursor, named [[Umbra.]] As the world took shape, Umbra became like a rampant cancer, insidiously devouring all the Creation it could reach.

Understanding the peril of Umbra, Arilias trapped the remaining dark energy into [[Svalgheim]], a [[Tangent World]] forever sealed off from Terra. It was here, that the Umbra morphed and mutated over millennia to transform into the dreaded hordes of the underworld.

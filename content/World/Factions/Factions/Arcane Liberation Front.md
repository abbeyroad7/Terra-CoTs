The Arcane Liberation Front, or ALF, is a resistance movement based out of the Aurelian sewers. Their mission statement is 'to liberate the use of Arcana and harness its power for the well-being of all peoples worldwide'.

It is said they harbor multiple underground cells across the lands of Gloridia and the Duchy of Westler.

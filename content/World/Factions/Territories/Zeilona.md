The bread basket of the west, Zeilona is an agrarian society known for its lush fields that follow the many rivers that flow through its flatlands.

Many have attempted to conquer Zeilona in the times of Arcanum, but its rulers proved unyielding and its people steadfast. A trade ally of much of the west, including its much larger neighbor, Gloridia, since the inception of the [[Western Eternal Treaty of 1532]].

Unable to pay and to further fuel their conquests to the east, Gloridia began amassing debt in lieu of payment to Zeilona in order to further supply their conquests to the east. The debt soon grew to be outrageous. By 1625, all trade stopped between the nations. Gloridia, being dependent on the supply and not having the means for repayment, invaded Zeilona. Zeilonans fought bravely, but were no match for the far technical advancements of Gloridia. The nobility locked themselves in their high towers, leaving the people to their fate. The country was devastated, Gloridian troops razed villages and burned crops. They destroyed the very thing they were after, a sustainable food supply. By 1628, Zeilona nobles that haven't assimilated where exiled. Now only the dredges remain for the freedom of Zeilona. Gorilla warfare is imminent.

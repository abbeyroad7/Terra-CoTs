Upon returning to ALF-HQ, the party was commended for bringing back the fae prisoners, [[Elli Peer]] and [[Puck]].

Soon after, Borislav's hip began to suspiciously warm and pulsate with a faint blue light. After rummaging through his pockets, he revealed the golden key that the party had been gifted from saving [[Batti Knave, Innkeeper|Batti]] and [[Wald Knave, Innkeeper|Wald]] at the [[Knave's Scroll]].

The mysterious key beared an insignia that [[Rasha Moonstar|Rasha]] recognized. Upon further study, [[Goobert]] revealed that the key bore an origin bereft of the old artisans from before [[The Arcanum Wars]].

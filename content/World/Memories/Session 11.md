# The Search for Hilda: The Dwarven Tunnels
The morning after the party had returned from the [Aurelian National Bank](https://abbeyroad7.github.io/Terra-CoTs/Aurelian-National-Bank), they awoke to [Gunnar](https://abbeyroad7.github.io/Terra-CoTs/World/Characters/Allies/Gunnar-Goldvein) crying to himself in his cot. [Matilda](https://abbeyroad7.github.io/Terra-CoTs/World/Characters/Allies/Matilda-Goldvein) was angrily heaving her handaxe at a pile of loose wood.

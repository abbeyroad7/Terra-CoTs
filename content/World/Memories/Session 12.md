# The Lone Ranger and the Bear
After taking a short-rest, the party abandoned their rowboat and climbed out of the cave. Outside the cavern, [[Player Characters|The Good Guys]] stood on a small eyot.

The river before them rushed past. They could see a flock of [[Cloudhopper|Cloudhoppers]] bounce overhead.

After devising a plan to cross, Goobert tied a rope to the lone oak tree near the cave's entrance and dived into the river with it in-tow.

He crossed and secured the rope with a a stake from his pack and the party managed to cross with their cargo.

On land, they discovered a set of small boot prints leading to the forest. They followed and came upon a dirt road. Continuing onward, they met a split in the path. As they arbitrated on which direction to take, Borislav took notice of the fallen statue. It was of [[Malik Windwalker]], a Gloridian folk-hero, famous for single-handedly defeating an army of orcs in [[The Arcanum Wars]]. The statue had been felled and decapitated.

The party settled on taking the path heading east based on a vision from [[Leika's Stone]].

Up the road, they encountered a common brown bear. [[Borislav]] was slashed and bitten before the party managed to drop the beast and scavenge its corpse for its pelt and meat.

Further along, they came to a lumber camp. The entrance was open, with blood smeared across the ground.

# The Churchyard Massacre
Renroc led the party inside his safe house, where the party met Hilda. She welcomed the party warmly, and ushered them inside to rest.

In the middle of the night, everyone (minus Scribbles of course) awoke to a soft click of the back door opening. Renroc sprinted to the door while the rest of the party instinctively hid. A lone shadowy figure entered the room, and the Celestrian commander, used Suggestion to persuade them to fall to the ground on their hands and knees. Standing over the figure, Renroc called out to the party if they recognized the intruder, and Elara clarified that it was Freya.

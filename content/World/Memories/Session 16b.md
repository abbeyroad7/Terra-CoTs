After taking a short rest at the Tavern, the party hear a knock at the door, where a GUY comes through asking if they'd been looking for him. He guides [[Borislav]] and [[Scribbles]] to a corner table, where OTHER is sitting.

The four talked over recent events, where they had met Hilda and Co, and been ambushed at the church. The party fled to gather GUY, and rally more fighters to oppose the Celestrians somehow. They concluded that they needed to gather more intel on Celestrian plans, by breaking into the Citadel.

After agreeing on a plan, the party gathered to a nearby wearhouse the GUYS worked at. Here, they changed their clothes to various cloth coverings in order to disguise as civilians.

While changing, two Celestrian guards entered the warehouse, and commanded everyone outside to witness the daily executions. A large crowd had gathered at the gallows. Among the three doomed men, was OLD and KING.

A commanding officer addressed the crowd, declaring their intention to put down any rebellion aligned with the King. They pulled the lever, releasing the death door for the OLD and BANKER. In a charming display of affectation for the King, the party rallied the crowd to push to give the King a final kiss. This angered the guards, who responded by killing an old woman. Outraged, a riot ensued.

In the chaos, the party launched [[Yeldarb]] onto the stage and engaged with the soldiers. Soonafter, from behind the gallows, the Celestrians led a chained giant Monstrosity with a slingblade fixated into his arm. Unable to hold the Monstrosity any longer, it tore through the stage, killing several soldiers in the process.

The crowd and soldiers fled alike, and the party retreated to the warehouse across the street, where the monster followed. In a final showdown in the warehouse, the party fell the monster (almost too easily) and took stock of their weapons.

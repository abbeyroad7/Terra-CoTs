# Introduction
- There will be danger for players as they navigate the open world of [[Terra]]. It is not my intention for player character to fall victim to these dangers, but they must practice proper caution and wherewithall to not die before the campaign wraps up. This is DND though, and there is always a chance the dice choose your destiny.
- In the event your player character is downed and fails all of their *Death Saving Throws*, do not take your frustrations out on me as a DM. Refer again to the Player Behavior section above.

# Afterdeath
- I will privately reach out to you and ask what your compromise will be. I do not intend to make this campaign a constant struggle between life and death, but I will not shy away from player death if events unfold that way.
- You can choose to temporarily hiatus your character to be revived by the party or an evil necromancer for example.
- You can introduce another character to join the party, as an already existing character, or an entirely new one.
- You can continue the arc of your character by bringing them back in another form, as a ghost or spirit for example.
- Whatever you choose, I will work with you to compromise on life after death. Just be reasonable.

In the depths of the Aurelian sewers, the party came upon an empty alcove, which held an old and unlabeled wooden lever. Curious, Yeldarb pulled it with all his strength, and snapped the handle in two, ensuring that it stood stuck in the on-position. As he pulled, the sound of heavy cog-wheels creaked. Outside the room, the sewer pipe leading to the second level of the sewer system, emptied of water - allowing the party to scramble up the pipe and into the second level.

After meeting Squall, it is revealed that the lever controls the sewer system's water level. Squall assures the group that it is a matter that can wait, and he ushers them to join him and meet his group. He leads the party back to a cavern where the Aurelian resistance have taken shelter. After being welcomed and fed, everyone is awakened the next morning after a large puddle of water has flooded the base entrance. Gareth and Squall pledge to lead the party back to the main lever to repair damages and restore the water level before the entire second level is flooded.

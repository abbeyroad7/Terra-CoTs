Shortly after arriving to the Knave's Scroll Tavern, the party stepped in to save the bar-keep Wald and his son Batti from Celestrian soldiers. In the ensuing brawl, Wald had his throat slit, prompting the party to defeat the aggressors and stabilize the gravely-wounded man. With vapid breath, Wald held out his hand and handed Borislav a rustic golden key. He explained that it was to unlock a family vault in the Aurelian National Bank. Unable to muster the strength to explain its contents, he lost consciousness shortly after. Batti thanked the party for their heroism and frantically began packing essentials to flee the country with his injured father.
